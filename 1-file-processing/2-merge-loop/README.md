# 2. Merge files with loop

Merge multiple arbitrary files into one file in python using a loop. You must be able to detect what files are in a folder.

## Usage

Edit the `merge.py` file and add an implementation of the `merge` function.

- Merge all files with an `.sql` extension in the folder `sqls`
- Save the file to `merged.sql`

Run `pytest` if you have passed this exercise.
